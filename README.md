# LocalBusinessFinder
yelp api business finder

I created this program when I saw a coworker searching Yelp to find contact information of local businesses and manually inputting it into an excel sheet.
I researched the API and created a program that outputs the contact information of the first 25 local businesses based on search results of different cities.
As a user, all you need to do is change the city, and run the program.

### Expected Output
Name, Address, Phone Number of each business in a .csv file.
Open the .csv in Excel to see a formatted Excel sheet of local businesses.
